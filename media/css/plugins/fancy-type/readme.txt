Fancy Type

* Gives you classes to use if you'd like some 
  extra fancy typography. 

Credits and instructions are specified above each class
in the fancy-type.css file in this directory.


Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------

1) Add this line to your HTML:
	 <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/blueprint/plugins/fancy-type/fancy-type-compressed.css" 
	  type="text/css" media="screen, projection">	
	
	(Remember to customize the href path.)


Note that this uses the compressed version of the CSS file, 
as the original file contains a lot of instructing comments.

Remember to re-compress (or change) the compressed file 
if you make any changes to the original CSS file.

Here's a pretty good CSS compressor:
